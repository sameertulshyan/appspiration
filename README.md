# Appspiration

Check out the deployed application [here](https://serene-lowlands-20570.herokuapp.com/) 

## Description

"I really want to use my skills as a software engineer to build something awesome ... I just need to figure out what 'something awesome' is!" - Every single software engineer, ever\* 

Here's the deal. I'm having a hard time thinking of *interesting* ideas for a web application. A fitness tracker? A restaurant finder? I can hear the sound of your eyes rolling into the back of your head. 

So, instead of waiting for some epic inspiration (I would probably still be waiting), I created a web application for developers to share their project ideas and solicit feedback from each other.
