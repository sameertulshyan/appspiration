# Appspiration

## Description

"I really want to use my skills as a software engineer to build something awesome ... I just need to figure out what 'something awesome' is!" - Every single software engineer, ever\* 

Here's the deal. I'm having a hard time thinking of **interesting** ideas for a web application. A fitness tracker? A restaurant finder? I can hear the sound of your eyes rolling into the back of your head. 

So, instead of waiting for some epic inspiration (I would probably still be waiting!), I created a web application for developers to share project ideas for (wait for it) *web applications*.
